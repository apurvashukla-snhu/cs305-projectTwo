CS-305 Project Two 

This project file was added for a portfolio submission. The project intent was to create a secure HTTPS connection and display a checksum by using a algorithm cipher and display a checksum that is generated by the developer's first and last name. 
This project also employed the use of Java Keytool which is not imported here due to system sensitive data being exposed.
