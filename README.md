CS-305 Project Two 


Artemis Financial, a finance company that has clients ranging from governments to business owners, had a software requirement that used a secure and reliable algorithm cipher that secured and protected information about the clients and the business. I identified their use case correctly, and gave them an indsutry standard cipher to use. It is important to code securely since vulnerabilites and bad actors are abundant in the online field, and since Artemis Financial is working with financial data, it is extremely important to protect this data. All of this adds to the reputation of the company as a secure entity for business.
The process was difficult when trying to find packages that have their vulnerabilites patched and packages that are false positives, as there was lots of coding review to determine what parts of a package was vulnerable and what part was flagged for a vulnerability that did not apply to the program being written.
How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
