CS-305 Project Two 


Artemis Financial, a finance company that has clients ranging from governments to business owners, had a software requirement that used a secure and reliable algorithm cipher that secured and protected information about the clients and the business. I identified their use case correctly, and gave them an indsutry standard cipher to use. It is important to code securely since vulnerabilites and bad actors are abundant in the online field, and since Artemis Financial is working with financial data, it is extremely important to protect this data. All of this adds to the reputation of the company as a secure entity for business.

The process was difficult when trying to find packages that have their vulnerabilites patched and packages that are false positives, as there was lots of coding review to determine what parts of a package was vulnerable and what part was flagged for a vulnerability that did not apply to the program being written.

The approach to increase layers of security was done by looking at current standards used in the industry, and would change certain stratgies such as understanding which specific cipher to use, and what packages to determine under false positives.


I believe I have shown my skills to research and use the appropriate ciphers, showcasing the use of certificates and keystores, display of coding abilities related to cybersecurity, elimination of false positives and proper use and maintainance of code to improve the security.
